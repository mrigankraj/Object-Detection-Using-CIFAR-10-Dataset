CIFAR dataset is the official dataset of tensorflow with having 60000 images in it and in this project we train 50000 images and test 10000 images.
CIFAR dataset is the official dataset of tensorflow with having 60000 images in it,for more info click on this link (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). In this project we will train 50000 images and test 10000 images In this code I have split the data as 50000 for training and 10000 for testing by using a basic algorithm that is CNN(Convolution Nural Network).For detailed explanation on CNN you can refer to (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/convolutional-neural-networks-python?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=1455363063&utm_adgroupid=65083631748&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=1t1&utm_creative=332602034358&utm_targetid=aud-299261629574:dsa-473406581915&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=1007740&gclid=CjwKCAjw04vpBRB3EiwA0Iieas7gToq0j3EmlOKNesgUsjvtzQEtlejdjfhhzAGT-mAiOiKEglGkEhoCOq8QAvD_BwE)

For more examples on CNN you can refer this document (https://keras.io/search.html?q=cnn). Now lets get into the code open the document code. when it comes to accuracy, it all depends upon your computational power.
